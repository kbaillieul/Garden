This is my second project through the Get Coding program that is currently under development. The intended function of this project is as follows:

1. User selects a tomato, corn, or sunflower plant from the 'Add a Plant' dropdown and presses the Submit button.
2. An image of the selected plant is added to the garden and an option for 'Water a Plant' is created.
3. The user can select from the 'Water a Plant' dropdowns to water the plants they have selected to include in the garden. Upon clicking the Submit button for 'Water a Plant' the image of the plant in the garden changes and becomes larger.
4. If the user's garden contains all 3 plant types and waters each plant twice, a cloud animation moves across the screen. The cloud stops in the middle of the screen and a rain animation begins. Once the rain animation is complete, the cloud moves off screen and a sun with a banner is displayed.
5. A 'Play Again' button is available to reload the page and start a new garden.
