This is my second project through the Get Coding program that is currently under development. The intended function of this project is as follows:

1. User selects a plant from the 'Add a Plant' dropdown and presses the Submit button.
2. An image of the selected plant is added to the garden and an option for 'Water a Plant' is created.
3. The user can select from the 'Water a Plant' dropdowns to water the plants they have selected to include in the garden. Upon clicking the Submit button for 'Water a Plant' the image of the plant in the garden changes and becomes larger.
